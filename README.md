  The Simple Library Management System (LMS) is a console-based system developed for
efficient library management and book transaction processing. Created in Python code, this
system is developed for four different types of users with unique privileges: Admin for
managing the system, 'Library Staff' for managing transactions, 'Library Members' for
borrowing books, and 'Visitors' for simple searching.
  The system covers all basic library functions such as managing book catalogs, registering
borrowers, borrowing and returning books, searching, and reporting. With data storage based
on files, all records are maintained without relying on complex databases.
  This is a demonstration of how basic programming concepts such as control structures,
functions, lists, and file operations can be applied with structured programming practices and
menu-driven interfaces for maximal user convenience
